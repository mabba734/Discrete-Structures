# Discrete Structures Projects

This folder contains several small algorithmic projects completed for my Discrete Structures course.  
Each project focuses on core problem-solving skills and fundamental computer science concepts such as recursion, matrix operations, graph theory, and tree traversal.

These projects were implemented to build a stronger foundation in algorithms and logic, which are essential for technical interviews and real-world software development.

## Project 1 — Recurrence Relations

Implemented functions to solve recurrence relations and analyze their closed-form behavior.  
The project covered:
- Writing recursive definitions
- Expanding recurrence equations
- Understanding time-complexity growth patterns
- Translating mathematical relations into code

## Project 2 — Gaussian Elimination

Built a matrix-based solver using Gaussian Elimination to:
- Reduce matrices to row-echelon form
- Solve systems of linear equations
- Detect inconsistent or dependent systems
- Work with numerical precision and row operations

This strengthened my understanding of matrix manipulation and algorithmic reasoning.

## Project 3 — Binary Tree Traversal Algorithms

Implemented multiple traversal algorithms for binary trees:
- In-order traversal  
- Pre-order traversal  
- Post-order traversal  
- Level-order traversal (BFS)

This project focused on recursion, data structures, and working with hierarchical relationships.

## Project 4 — Dijkstra's Algorithm

Developed a shortest-path solver for weighted graphs using Dijkstra's Algorithm.  
Key elements included:
- Priority queues / min-heap behavior
- Tracking visited nodes
- Computing shortest paths efficiently
- Representing graphs using adjacency lists or matrices

This project introduced practical graph algorithms often used in routing, networks, and optimization problems.
